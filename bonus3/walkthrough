-- Code analysis --
Code open and read .pass and store it into a buffer

```
if (ac == 2) {
```
-> We need 2 arg

```
buff[atoi(av[1])] = 0;
```
-> buff[atoi(av[1])] = 0 // Will only consider what before that to be the string to compare

```
if (!strcmp(buff, av[1]))
  execl("/bin/sh", "sh", 0);
```
-> Win block, if our buffer match our atoi(av[1])
atoi('') = 0 so at buff[0] = 0, because of the code right above
So we match the strcmp with the arg and what inside buf
